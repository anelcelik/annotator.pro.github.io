# Screen Annotator Pro

> Draw, highlight, annotate, redact, and OCR anything on your screen — live, in real time, without interrupting what's behind it.

A fullscreen transparent overlay built with **Python + PyQt6**. The overlay sits on top of all windows; you draw on it like a whiteboard, then hide it or clear it when you're done. Everything runs locally — no cloud, no account.

Available on the **Microsoft Store** · **Current version: 2.2.7**

## How it works

Screen Annotator Pro creates a transparent, click-through window that covers your entire screen (or all monitors). When you activate it, the overlay intercepts mouse input so you can draw shapes, write text, and apply redactions directly on top of whatever application is underneath. When you hide or pause the overlay, the underlying apps regain full mouse control instantly — no restart, no alt-tab, no disruption.

The app lives in the system tray and is toggled with a global hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+A` by default) so you can flip it on and off in under a second during a presentation, meeting, or tutorial recording.
