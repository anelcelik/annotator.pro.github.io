# Screen Annotator Pro

> Draw, highlight, annotate, redact, and OCR anything on your screen — live, in real time, without interrupting what's behind it.

A fullscreen transparent overlay built with **Python + PyQt6**. The overlay sits on top of all windows; you draw on it like a whiteboard, then hide it or clear it when you're done. Everything runs locally — no cloud, no account.

**$0.99** on the **Microsoft Store** · one-time purchase · **Current version: 4.0.0**

## How it works

Screen Annotator Pro creates a transparent, click-through window that covers your entire screen (or all monitors). When you activate it, the overlay intercepts mouse input so you can draw shapes, write text, and apply redactions directly on top of whatever application is underneath. When you hide or pause the overlay, the underlying apps regain full mouse control instantly — no restart, no alt-tab, no disruption.

The app lives in the system tray and is toggled with a global hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+A` by default) so you can flip it on and off in under a second during a presentation, meeting, or tutorial recording.

## OCR & Translation

Press `J` (or `Ctrl+T` by default, configurable in Settings) to activate Snip & Read, then drag a rectangle over any text on screen. A resizable popup appears with:

- **Recognized text** — extracted via [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR), runs fully offline with no API key
- **Translate to** — pick any of 50+ languages and press **Go** to translate via Google Translate
- **Copy** buttons for both the OCR result and the translation

> **First use:** The EasyOCR model (~150 MB) is downloaded once and cached in `%APPDATA%\ScreenAnnotatorPro\ocr_models` (Windows) or `~/.config/ScreenAnnotatorPro/ocr_models` (Linux/macOS). All subsequent uses load instantly from disk.

### Supported translation languages

English, Bosnian, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Croatian, Slovak, Bulgarian, Serbian, Albanian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Slovenian, Catalan, Swahili, Afrikaans, Tagalog, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Uzbek, Mongolian.

## Toolbar Controls

A single horizontal dock sits at the bottom of the screen. The top row is every tool, always in the same place; the row below it shows only the properties the *active* tool actually uses — a color swatch and stroke slider for Pen, nothing at all for Select, a radius slider for Blur, and so on.

- **6-colour swatch row** + custom colour picker, when the tool uses colour
- **Opacity slider** (10–100 %), **Stroke size slider** (1–30 px), **Text size slider** (8–72 pt) — shown only for the tools that use them
- **Capture** — hides overlay, captures all monitors, shows Copy / Save PNG / Discard
- **Pause** — hides overlay; resume from tray or hotkey
- **Undo / Redo / Clear all**
- **Settings** — hotkey, OCR hotkey, start on boot, appearance, help reference

**Move it** by dragging the dotted grip at the left end — clicking a tool never moves the dock by accident. **Collapse it** by double-clicking that same grip: it shrinks down to a single draggable icon (the active tool, so you can always tell what's armed) that sits wherever you left it; click it once to expand back to the full dock. Wherever you leave it — collapsed or expanded — is remembered across restarts.

## Support

### Bug reports — please include

1. **What happened** — describe the problem and what you expected instead
2. **Steps to reproduce** — the exact sequence of actions that triggers it
3. **Version** — shown in Settings, bottom-right (e.g. `Version 4.0.0`)
4. **OS and display setup** — e.g. Windows 11, single 4K monitor; or Ubuntu 24.04 Wayland, dual monitors
5. **Error message or crash log** (if any) — on Windows, check `%APPDATA%\ScreenAnnotatorPro\` for any log files; on Linux run `python annotate.py` from terminal to see console output
6. **Screenshot or screen recording** (if visual) — helps a lot for rendering or layout bugs

### Feature requests

Open an issue with a clear description of the use case. What are you trying to do, and how does the current app fall short?

### What's in scope

- Drawing, annotation, and redaction tools
- OCR accuracy and language support
- Hotkey reliability and configurability
- Installer / packaging / update issues
- Performance on specific hardware or OS configurations
- Accessibility improvements

### Known limitations

- **Wayland (Linux):** Global hotkeys are not available — use the tray icon to toggle the overlay
- **macOS:** Not officially supported; the app runs from source but no packaged build is provided
- **Multiple monitors:** Overlay covers all monitors; per-monitor mode is not currently supported
- **OCR first-run:** The ~150 MB EasyOCR model downloads on first use; this requires an internet connection once
